1. Monthly Orders \& Revenue



Insight:

Monthly revenue shows strong seasonality, peaking in November 2017 at ₹1,010,271.37, while the lowest revenue is observed in December 2016. This pattern suggests increased customer spending during festive or promotional periods, which can be leveraged for targeted campaigns.



2\. Revenue by State

Revenue is highly concentrated in a few states. The top 3 states by revenue are:



SP: ₹5,067,633.16



RJ: ₹1,759,651.13



MG: ₹1,552,481.83



These states together contribute a significant share of total revenue, indicating regional dependence and potential growth opportunities in underperforming states.



3\. Revenue by Product Category



Insight:

While some categories have high order volumes, “beleza\_saude” generates the highest revenue at ₹1,258,681.34, indicating stronger pricing power or premium product demand compared to other categories.



4\. Repeat Customers



Insight:

There are 2,801 repeat customers who have placed more than one order. Although they form a small portion of the customer base, repeat customers are critical for long-term revenue growth and should be targeted through loyalty and retention strategies.



5\. Average Delivery Time



Insight:

The average delivery time is 12 days, which is generally acceptable for e-commerce logistics. However, variations across orders suggest opportunities to further optimize delivery operations and improve customer satisfaction.



6\. Late Deliveries



Insight:

A total of 7,827 orders were delivered later than the estimated delivery date, with delays extending up to 188 days in extreme cases. These late deliveries highlight significant logistics inefficiencies that can negatively impact customer experience and trust.



7\. High Freight Cost Orders



Insight:

Only around 50 orders incur exceptionally high freight costs, yet they disproportionately increase overall logistics expenses. This suggests a need for freight optimization, especially for bulky or long-distance deliveries.



8\. Cancellation Percentage



Insight:

Approximately 0.7% of orders are cancelled, which is relatively low. However, even this small percentage directly impacts revenue and operational efficiency, making cancellation monitoring an important KPI.
